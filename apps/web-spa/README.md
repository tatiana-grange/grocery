## Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have installed:
- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) (version 24.13.0)
- [pnpm](https://pnpm.io/) (version 10.28.2)

## Getting Started

1. Install dependencies:
```bash
pnpm install
```

2. Set up environment variables
```bash
cp .env.example .env
```

3. Start the development server:
```bash
pnpm dev
```

The application will be available at `http://localhost:5173`

## Available Scripts

- `pnpm dev` - Start the development server
- `pnpm build` - Build the application for production
- `pnpm preview` - Preview the production build locally

## Environment Variables

### Environment Variables Management in a SPA

In a SPA, environment variables must be defined at build time as they are integrated into the JavaScript bundle. This means you cannot simply change these variables after the build without rebuilding the application.

### Available Environment Variables

| Variable | Description | Required | Default |
|----------|-------------|----------|---------|
| `VITE_API_URL` | Backend API URL | Yes | - |

> **Note**: All environment variables used in the application must start with `VITE_` to be accessible in the client code.

## Building with Docker

### Building the Image

```bash
# At the project root
docker build -t lonestone/web-spa \
  --build-arg VITE_API_URL=https://api.example.com \
  -f apps/web-spa/Dockerfile .
```

### Running the Container

```bash
docker run -p 80:80 lonestone/web-spa
```

### Runtime Variable Replacement

If you need to replace certain environment variables without rebuilding the image, you can use the runtime replacement mechanism:

```bash
docker run -p 80:80 \
  -e VITE_API_URL=https://api-staging.example.com \
  lonestone/web-spa
```

> **Important**: This mechanism works by searching for placeholders like `%VITE_API_URL%` in JavaScript files and replacing them with the provided values. For this to work, your code must use these placeholders.

Example usage in code:

```typescript
// Direct usage (will be replaced at runtime)
const apiUrl = '%VITE_API_URL%'

// Or with a default value
const apiUrl = '%VITE_API_URL%' || 'https://api.default.com'
```

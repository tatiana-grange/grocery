pnpm install
```

2. Setup env variables

```bash
cp .env.example .env
```

3. Start the development server:

# SSR (Server-Side Rendering) Application

This application uses server-side rendering (SSR) to improve performance and SEO.

## Environment Variables

Unlike a SPA, an SSR application can use environment variables at runtime because rendering is done on the server side.

| Variable | Description | Required | Default |
|----------|-------------|----------|---------|
| `VITE_API_URL` | Backend API URL | Yes | - |
| `NODE_ENV` | Environment (development, production) | No | `development` |

See [.env.example](./.env.example) as a reference.

## Building with Docker

### Building the Image

```bash
# At the project root
docker build -t lonestone/web-ssr -f apps/web-ssr/Dockerfile .
```

### Running the Container

```bash
docker run -p 3000:3000 \
  -e VITE_API_URL=https://api.example.com \
  -e NODE_ENV=production \
  lonestone/web-ssr
```

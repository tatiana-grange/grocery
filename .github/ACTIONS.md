# GitHub Workflows

This folder contains the GitHub Actions workflows for the Grocery project.

## Available workflows

### CI (Continuous Integration)

The CI workflow (`workflows/ci.yml`) runs on every push to `main`, and on pull requests targeting `main`.

It includes the following jobs:

#### Lint

- Checks the code with Oxlint.
- Command: `pnpm lint`

#### Knip

- Detects unused files and dependencies.
- Command: `pnpm knip`

#### Build

- Builds all packages and applications with `pnpm -r build`.
- Does not regenerate OpenAPI clients (that needs a running API).

#### Type Check

- Checks TypeScript types for all packages and applications with `pnpm -r run typecheck`.
- Runs after the build job; it does not run `pnpm generate` first.

#### Test

- Runs the workspace test suite with `pnpm test`.

## Configuration

The workflow uses:

- Node.js 24.13.0
- pnpm 10.28.2
- Cache for pnpm dependencies
- Official actions for checkout, plus the local `setup-node-pnpm` composite action

## Adding a new workflow

To add a new workflow:

1. Create a new `.yml` file in the `workflows/` folder.
2. Define the events that trigger the workflow (push, pull_request, and so on).
3. Define the jobs and steps.
4. Commit and push the file.
